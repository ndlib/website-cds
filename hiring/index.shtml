        <br>
        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Center for Digital Scholarship (CDS) leverages  state-of-the art technologies, enabling students and faculty to explore new  methodologies, analyze complex data and share research results in innovative  ways.  The Center offers the Notre Dame  community access to consultations with experts in digital scholarship fields, free educational  workshops and seminars, specialized hardware/software, and collaborative work  spaces. </p>
        <p>Technical Assistants  (TA) serve a particularly critical role, as this  position functions as one of the initial points of contact for students, faculty, and  staff users in the CDS space, and provides entry level technical and referral assistance. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Primary Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Baseline duties include such tasks as opening/closing the Center, maintaining  the environment, collecting user statistics, circulating items,  troubleshooting/providing technical assistance to users, and fielding  walk-in/phone inquiries.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Additional  Requirements</h3>
        <p>In addition to regular shift duties, all Technical Assistantswill  be required to complete tasks associated with CDS projects and other Library  projects as requested. For example, our Division Project Manager may ask us to  assign Technical Assistants to upload scanned images to our digital repository during the course  of several shifts, or TAs may be asked to try a new software and document its  basic functions for publishing as a resource on our web site. </p>
        <p>As the initial point of contact and support for CDS users, TAs must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Possess knowledge of the CDS programs, operations, and staff.</li>
          <li>Be on duty at the Help Desk during assigned shifts, independently providing support to CDS users.</li>
          <li>Provide directions, information, and appropriate referrals for Hesburgh Libraries users.</li>
          <li>Perform a variety of regularly-recurring tasks during shifts.</li>
          <li>For select shifts, open and/or close the CDS, provide closure notifications to users in advance of closing, and ensure the CDS doors, and ensure the CDS doors are locked at closing time.</li>
          <li>Assist with setup and cleanup of events as needed.</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Additional Opportunities </h3>
        <p>Technical Assistants with the requisite skill sets (or who express an interest in gaining requisite skills) will have opportunities to assist Library faculty/staff with digital scholarship projects, as well as projects such as systematic reviews of literature, online tutorial creation, research guide creation/editing, investigations of emerging technologies and resources, and creative projects. &nbsp;<br>
        </span></b></p>
        <p>Technical Assistants who contribute to work that is later published or presented will be acknowledged appropriately. &nbsp;</p>
        The CDS is committed to ensuring that our Technical Assistants find their time on our team to be advantageous to their professional development, and we are happy to consider Technical Assistant proposals of projects that overlap with CDS priorities and the TA&rsquo;s research/professional development interests.</span></b><br>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Assistant Leads</h3>
       <p>Interested TAs may select one area (3D printing, large-format printing, metrics, documentation, teaching introductory-level workshops (in a relevant digital scholarship field)) for which they will receive additional, specialized training, and then be designated the lead (or one of a small group of leads) Technical Assistant responsible for that area. &nbsp;</span></b><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Work Environment<br>
        </h3>
        <p>Occasional lifting, carrying, pushing/pulling, stooping, kneeling,  crouching/crawling (e.g., related to special event furniture reconfiguration, or the need to work with cords under a table).  This job is  performed in a generally hazard-free environment in a clean atmosphere.  80% sitting | 20% walking/standing<br>
          <br>
